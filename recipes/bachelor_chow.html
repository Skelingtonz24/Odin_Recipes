            <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp anchovy paste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 garlic head, peeled</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1/2 ounce dried prcini mushrooms</li>
            <li>10 sprigs fresh parsley</li>
            <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>1 bottle Burgundy wine</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups boiling water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim excess fat from beef chuck and reserve.</li>
            <li>Chop beef into 2 inch chunks and slice salt pork into 1 inch strips.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle beef with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temp. for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place beef scraps, salt pork, and butter into a roasting pan. Roast fo r 20 minutes at 500 F, or until the fat is rendered and the meat browned.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle gelatin over the beef broth and allow to sit for 6 minutes until the gelation is completely hydrated.</li>
            <li>Once browned, remove beef scraps and salt pork from the roasting pan. Transfer roasting pan with rendered fat to stovetop.</li>
            <li>Add onions, carrots, and celery to roasting pan and saute over medium-high heat until the vegetables are lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato and anchovy pastes to the roasting pan and stir to combine. Cook for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and residual fat. Mix everything together until a homogenous paste develops coating the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the gelatin/broth mix to the pan, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, porcini mushrooms, parsley, thyme, and rosemary.</li>
            <li>Add the wine and stir until homogenous.</li>
            <li>Neatly place the chunks of beef in an even layer on top of the vegetables. Make sure the beef isn't entirely submerged in the braising liquid.</li>
            <li>Return the roasting pan to the oven and cook at 325 F for 3 hours. After 90 minutes, flip the pieces of beef and add water if the beef becomes less than halfway submerged.</li>
            <li>Once the beef is tender, remove the roasting pan from the oven. Reserve the pieces of beef in a separate bowl and strain the remaining sauce.</li>
            <li>Regrigerate the beef and sauce for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Once chilled, remove the solidified layer of fat from the sauce and cut the beef chunks into smaller cubes, about 1/2 in in size.</li>
            <li>Over medium-high heat, reduce the sauce until it becomes a thick, graby-like consistency, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool to room temp.</li>
            <li>Spread the beef into an even layer on freeze dryer trays. Pour the sauce onto a separate tray.</li>
            <li>Freeze dry the beef and sauce for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Once completely dry, remove the beef and sauce from the freeze dryer.</li>
            <li>Break up the sauce into manageable chunks and grind in a food processor until it becomes a fine powder.</li>
            <li>Toss the beef cubes in the sauce powder and serve in your bowl of choice.</li>
            <li>To rehydrate: pour hot water over top of Bachelor Chow and let sit for 5 minutes</li>
